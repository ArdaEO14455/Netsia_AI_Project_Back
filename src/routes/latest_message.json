  "content": "Most ducks can fly, but not all. The ability to fly depends on the species of duck. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Flying ducks:**\n\n* Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) - These are one of the most common duck species and are capable of flying.\n* Wood ducks (Aix sponsa) - These ducks are known for their striking colors and are strong fliers.\n* Mergansers (Mergus spp.) - These ducks are fish-eating specialists and are agile fliers.\n* Goldeneye ducks (Bucephala spp.) - These ducks are also fish-eaters and are capable of flying.\n\n**Non-flying ducks:**\n\n* Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) - These ducks are native to South America and are flightless.\n* Woodland ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) - Some subspecies of woodland ducks are not able to fly, or have very limited flying ability.\n* Dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) - Some species of dabbling ducks, such as the American black duck (Anas rubripes), have limited flying ability.\n\n**Why some ducks can't fly:**\n\nDucks that live in areas with abundant food and water, such as parks, gardens, or wetlands, may not need to fly to survive. These ducks may have evolved to become flightless over time, as they have less need to migrate or escape predators.\n\nIn summary, while most ducks can fly, there are some species that have lost the ability to fly over time.",
