When a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a button or submitting a form, the JavaScript code is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. The engine reads the JavaScript code, interprets its instructions, and executes them, allowing the web page to respond to user input and update dynamically. JavaScript code is typically embedded in HTML documents, where it can access and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to modify the page's content, layout, and behavior. As the user interacts with the page, the JavaScript engine continuously executes the code, updating the page's state and rendering the changes in real-time.",
